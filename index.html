    <h2>"What is Smile Bucks?"</h2>
   Smile Bucks are a currency that u can earn by selling your own items. For example: Snacks, Pencils, Candy, etc. You can also earn smile bucks by doing things like braiding hair or helping out with the smile bucks team! Obviously, you can do much more than just these 4 jobs, These are just some examples of jobs!
    <h2>"How does the banking of Smile Bucks work?"</h2>
    Basically, this is just how you earn smile bucks, And how you getting paid works. It depends on your job how much you get paid each recess, but for example, braiding hair pays 20 smile bucks per recess, and selling snacks or etc pays 10 smile bucks per recess.
    <h2>"How do i get a job/ or get hired?"</h2>
    You can get a job and get hired by finding one of our workers and asking them (you can either look for me (Luna) or for Madison to help you with your job) We will either interview you that day or the next day. We would prefer if you have a resume that we can read, but it's also fine if you don't! (you can either start your own business or work for someone else by the way!) 
    <h2>"Why was Smile Bucks made?"</h2>
    Well, we made this website because we wanted to make a currency that people could use to earn and spend, like just simply buying snacks to eat during lunch, or buying some stationery for class! We also just thought it would be fun to make a currency for our school!
    <h2>"Can I write for the daily newspaper?"</h2>
    Yes! You can write for the daily newspaper, but you have to be a member of the Smile Bucks team! But even then you can't write it on your own, you would just have to simply help or give suggestions!
    <h2>"Can i spread the word even if i'm not from this school?"</h2>
    Yes! you can spread the word even if you're not from this school! You can just tell your other friends about this website or tell them about Smile Bucks and that your school should start using the currency!
